# JavaScript 40 Challenges ✔️

This project contains **40 JavaScript challenges** that I completed to test and improve my understanding of core JavaScript concepts.

I made this project for one main reason:  
👉 **to check if I really know JavaScript.**

These challenges helped me practice:

- Arrays and objects
- `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `sort`, and other JS methods
- Logic building and data manipulation
- DOM manipulation (creating/updating elements)
- Working with real-world data structures

You can view all the challenges here:

Feel free to explore the challenges or use them to practice your own JS skills!
